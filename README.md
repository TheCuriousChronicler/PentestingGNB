# Pentesting GNB
Cybersecurity capstone where we simulate a hacker infiltrating a network of a small bank, from initial exploit to data exfiltration

Hello there! In this repo, you will find:
  HR - a VM meant to simulate a Human Resources database which is our attackers point of entry
  OpenSMTPD - a VM with a vulnerable mail server which we were able to pivot to from HR
  SysAdmin - our attacker's final stop, where he escalates to root and copies out sensitive "bank client data".
